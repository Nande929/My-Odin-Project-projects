            <li>½ tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package bacon, diced</li>
            <li>⅓ cup sliced green onions</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li> freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>cayenne pepper to taste</li>
            <li> ½ cup shredded sharp white Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons creme fraiche</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons fresh lime juice</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons shredded sharp white Cheddar cheese, or to taste</li>    
            
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place sweet potatoes on a baking sheet. Prick with a knife and drizzle with olive oil; rub to coat. Space sweet potatoes evenly apart.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until completely tender, about 35 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, add bacon to a pan over medium heat. Cook and stir until bacon starts to get crispy and the fat turns foamy, 4 to 5 minutes. Add green onions and jalapeño; cook and stir for 1 minute. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
            <li>Let sweet potatoes cool until safe to handle. Leave the oven on. Cut off the top 1/3 of each potato, holding the knife at a 45-degree angle. Scoop out sweet potato flesh from both the top and bottom halves, leaving at least 1/4 inch flesh in the bottoms to make the shells.</li>
            <li>Season the sweet potato flesh with salt, pepper, and cayenne. Add 1/2 cup cheese, creme fraiche, and lime juice. Mash with a potato masher. Add the bacon mixture and mix until combined. Spoon filling into the sweet potato shells. Lightly scatter remaining cheese on top.</li>
            <li>Bake until heated through and tops have started to brown, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
